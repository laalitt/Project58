            <h1>My Favorite Hobby <br><span id="name">Reading Books</span></h1>
          <p>I love books! It may sound strange, but I really do. Ever since I was a little girl I've read a lot of books.
My mother even used to ask me questions about the book I was reading, because she thought I read
too fast to understand anything. But I could always retell the story. I really love to drift away into the
fantasyworld of a book. This is what I think is the best about reading but there are other advantages
            about reading.</p>
